Madness considering the possible income when qualified but if you don&amp;#39;t have a mammy and daddy that can support you until that point it&amp;#39;s very tough to get there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s nothing new I had the same struggle meself ten years ago. As someone who grew up in/around the motor and construction trades. I hate to say it but a young Lad or Lass would be silly to even consider a trade these days. You gotta have it to make it - money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will also say that it&amp;#39;s not that it&amp;#39;s hard to find skilled people, alot of the time it&amp;#39;s actually a case that it&amp;#39;s hard to find &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; skilled people. There&amp;#39;s a man for every job but most know their worth &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The short answer is: Yes there is the beginning of skills shortage currently. we may get another ten years before the shit hits the fan. But bottom line is young people have too much sense these days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied":
